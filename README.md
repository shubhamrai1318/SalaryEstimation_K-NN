# SalaryEstimation_K-NN
The "Salary Estimation using K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)" project involves building a machine learning model to predict the salary of individuals based on various features. The project aims to demonstrate the application of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for regression tasks. Here's a detailed description of the project:

**Project Objective:**
The main objective of this project is to predict the salary of individuals based on a set of input features. By utilizing the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm, the project aims to create a regression model that can provide accurate salary estimates for different individuals.

**Project Steps:**

**Data Collection:** Obtain a dataset containing information about individuals, including features such as years of experience, education level, job role, location, and other relevant attributes. The dataset should also include the corresponding salary for each individual.

**Data Preprocessing:** Clean the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

**Feature Selection and Scaling:** Select relevant features that are likely to influence salary predictions. Scale or normalize the features to ensure that they are on a similar scale and contribute equally to the model.

**Train-Test Split:** Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the K-NN regression model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

**K-NN Algorithm:** Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for regression. The algorithm involves finding the 'k' nearest data points to a given input and averaging their corresponding salaries to predict the salary for that input.

**Hyperparameter Tuning:** Determine the optimal value of 'k' (number of neighbors) by using techniques like grid search or cross-validation. The choice of 'k' can significantly impact the model's performance.

**Model Training and Evaluation:** Train the K-NN regression model using the training data and the chosen value of 'k'. Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data using regression evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared.

**Prediction and Interpretation:** Use the trained model to make salary predictions for new, unseen data. Interpret the model's predictions and analyze which features have the most significant impact on salary estimates.
